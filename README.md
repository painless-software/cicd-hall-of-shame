CI/CD Hall Of Shame
===================

Educational examples of CI/CD pipeline implementations,
implementation patterns you should not follow.

Show-cased Patterns (Violations)
--------------------------------

- Copy and paste (DRY)
- Comments, excessive comments (self-explanatory code)
- Install tools on-the-fly (install once, use often)
- Spaghetti code (favor declarative over functional)
- Create results dynamically (use version control)

Disclaimer

all code is and show-cased approaches are fictitious. No animals
